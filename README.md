# Group14
## Overview
---
We, as a group have chosen the Cardiac Heart Disease, because it is more applicable to the Modules covered in the course. It is a complex dataset with values that needs to be trained, cleaned and split. My role in the group involves data exploration. See Table below which highlights my role and others in my group. My role is to perform Data Exploration on the dataset in Python. The table below is an agreed upon, roles and responsibilities for each group member in Group 14.

## Process used in preparing data exploration in python

I installed various libraries, that included the following: See file [heart_disease](https://github.com/mueeze/Group14/blob/Jared-Murray/heart_disease.ipynb)

These libraries were installed to run split testing and predictive modelling in machine learning. 

Checking and cleaning the credit card transaction data, I used the .loc method on the dataframe updated_heart_disease_df to obtain the credit card transactions obtain the Heart Disease Rates by age and gender. Which was indicated through Male and Female.

I created a new heart disease dataframe, updated_heart_disease_df, at first as a csv file to save the cleaned data. It holds and renames the columns 'Male' to 'Gender'. Note, in order to clean the data I described the data, dtyped the data and dropped the null values, as well as the column 'education'. 

To identify the glucose intake per age, I stored the values in the variable blood_sugar_levels and then plotted the glucose intake based on age. See Scatter plot below.

Please note that this project is a continuous project over the next 4 weeks.
